I am creating an Angular Application titled as (Hermes-Emergency Information Provider) which is used during emergency situation categories such as Natural disasters like floods , or Accidents like (fire-accidents,Pipeline burts,Water Dam breaches,etc)& Women safety(to report criminal incidents ).
It is used for effective co-ordination among first responders,victims so that we can help them by providing necessary helpline numbers for support services.
Helpline numbers & support services include nearest hospitals,Police station addresses in our traced locality.And a user has to report an incident he/she has observed through a form provided in the application where he is able to put name,mobile number , description of incident.
 This information is sent to police.My Angular application consists of Admin user who is able to create new information like adding new hospitals,new helpline numbers or even removing&updating them.
And the application's Dashboard page or Home page is mainly classified into 3 parts 'Header','Nav','Main' .
Header consists of title(Hermes),logo,quotation field , Current Location status& admin button at right corner for admin login.
Nav bar consists of Nav-Home button & different categories involved below it in application like Home,Natural Disasters,Accidents, Women Safety , Child safety , Local assitance as buttons when clicked will redirect to new pages in  'Main' part.
After clicking these category buttons nav bar has to slide back.
Main Body part should consists Title,pics,Animations,Current city & weather-around bar/block ,About the application description field ,and also space to add other functionalities
